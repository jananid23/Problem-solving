Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is greater than all of its prior elements.
Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.
For example,
Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
Example 1:
Input 
5 -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
7-> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
8-> Value of Arr[2]
2-> Value of Arr[3]
9-> Value of Arr[4]
Output :
3
Example 2:
5   -> Value of N, represents size of Arr
3  -> Value of Arr[0]
4 -> Value of Arr[1]
5 -> Value of Arr[2]
8 -> Value of Arr[3]
9 -> Value of Arr[4]
Output : 
5

C:

#include<stdio.h>
int count(int arr[],int n){
    int c=1,max=arr[0];
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
        
        if(arr[i]>max){
            c++;
        }
        
    }
    return c;
}
int main(){
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int arr[n];
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
    }
    int output=count(arr,n);
    printf("count %d",output);
    return 0;
}

PYTHON:
 def count(arr,n):
    max=arr[0]
    c=1
    for i in range(1,n):
        if(arr[i]>max):
            c=c+1
    return c
n=int(input("enter total no. of elements"))
arr = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
output=count(arr,n)
print("total count is",output)
