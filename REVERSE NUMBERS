Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:
Input: x = 120
Output: 21

SOLUTION:

n = int(input("Enter number: "))
i = 0
l = abs(n)  # Work with the absolute value of n to reverse digits correctly

while l > 0:
    a = l % 10
    i = i * 10 + a
    l = l // 10

# If the original number was negative, make the result negative
if n < 0:
    i = -i

print("The reverse is", i)
