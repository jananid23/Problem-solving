You have given two sorted arrays arr1[] & arr2[] of distinct elements. The first array has one element extra added in between. Return the index of the extra element.
Note: 0-based indexing is followed.
Examples
Input: n = 7, arr1[] = {2,4,6,8,9,10,12}, arr2[] = {2,4,6,8,10,12}
Output: 4
Explanation: In the first array, 9 is extra added and it's index is 4.
Input: n = 6, arr1[] = {3,5,7,8,11,13}, arr2[] = {3,5,7,11,13}
Output: 3
Explanation: In the first array, 8 is extra and it's index is 3.

SOLUTION:

#include<stdio.h>
void extra(int arr1[],int arr2[],int n1,int n2){
    int i=0,j=0;
    while(i<n1 && j<n2){
        if(arr1[i]==arr2[j]){
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        else{
            printf("the extra element %d at %d",arr1[i],i);
            break;
        }
    }
}
int main(){
    int arr1[] = {2,4,6,8,9,10,12};
    int arr2[] = {2,4,6,8,10,12};
    int n1=sizeof(arr1)/sizeof(arr1[0]);
    int n2=sizeof(arr2)/sizeof(arr2[0]);
    extra(arr1,arr2,n1,n1);
    return 0;
}
